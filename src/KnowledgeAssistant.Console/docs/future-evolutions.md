# Future Evolutions

This document lists potential evolutions of the project that are
explicitly out of scope for the current version.

## V2 — Additional knowledge sources

### PDF documents support

- Add support for PDF files as a knowledge source
- Introduce a dedicated parsing layer to extract textual content
- Keep the Domain and Application layers unchanged
- Provide a new Infrastructure implementation or parser strategy

This evolution is intentionally excluded from the initial version
to preserve simplicity and focus on the core RAG pipeline.
