# AI .NET Integration

This repository documents outlines a practical learning path focused on integrating artificial intelligence into .NET applications using C#.

The objective is to build a strong, practical understanding of how AI can be integrated into real-world software systems, with an emphasis on clean architecture, maintainability, and professional development practices.

## Why this repository exists

Modern applications increasingly rely on AI-powered features such as text analysis, automation, and intelligent decision support.  
This repository serves as a structured, practical workspace to:

- Understand where AI fits in a .NET application architecture
- Learn how to integrate AI services responsibly and effectively
- Develop production-oriented coding habits
- Track technical progress over time in a clear and transparent way

---

## Learning approach

The learning process is based on:
- Short daily work sessions (around 1 hour)
- Incremental improvements to a real codebase
- Clear separation between application logic and AI concerns
- Regular documentation of design decisions and lessons learned

The repository evolves progressively, reflecting each step of the learning process rather than presenting a finished product upfront.
